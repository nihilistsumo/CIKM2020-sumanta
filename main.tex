\begin{abstract}
While within the TREC Complex Answer Retrieval track, effective retrieval methods for passages have been developed, in this work we focus on arranging the relevant passages into related sub-topics. In particular, we aim to help users with vague information needs, who are not yet prepared to form a specific search query but express topical interests. Many vague information needs are best answered through complex and multi-faceted answers arranged in groups of sub-topics ---similar to a comprehensive article. Despite advances in clustering and topic models, these often fail to identify fine-grained subtopics within unambiguous search results. Recent success of Transformer-based language understanding models on NLP tasks shows that they have great potential in modeling fine-grained topical structure in individual sentences. However, many complex topics deserve a complex answer that cannot be expressed in a single sentence. Hence, we focus on an approach that can reason about multi-sentence paragraphs in an attempt to arrange them based on the underlying subtopic. Our proposed method utilizes the topical understanding of BERT-based embedding models with several simple yet effective modifications to arrange passages that are relevant for the query. Of course, different queries require different subtopics and our model is general enough to identify new subtopics for unseen queries. Our best performing method outperforms a pure BERT-based clustering by up to 45\%.
